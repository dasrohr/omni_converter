OMNI_CONVERTER
The omni_converter is a self written solution in python to download media from the web, and store them on the hard drive and make them available to the media server solution PLEX.
It uses different tools written by thierd-parties.

THE DOWNLOADER
  to download the files from the web, this uses the python implementation of youtube_dl
  youtube_dl is able to download all kind of media from the web from MANY different portals. For e.g.:
    - youtube, myvideo, soundcloud, ... (see youtube_dl for a full list)
  it is configured to convert video-files into mp3 files automatically.

USAGE:
  http://server-domain:port/video-url::arg_1::arg_x

video-url
  is the full url to a video, a file or a playlist
  Example:
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqxWTJhBMyQ
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u6o6wdFeto&index=2&list=PL_GIjsCumTTlMkPvRR1To-fhxSdXM0e2w

arg_x
  there are a couple of arguments available that can be passed to change the behaviour of certain parts of the omni_converter
  Arguments can be combined and get seperated by '::'
  Possible arguments are:
    - list      switch to enable the download of a playlist instead just one video
    - debug     enable debug output in the logs
    - nodl      skip the download and do a dry-run
    - folder    folder defines the actual folder to be used on the FS and defines the albumartist and album of the loaded file
                  - folder=albumartist/album    -> sets the albumartist to 'albumartist' and the album to 'album'
                                                    the script performs a clostest match on the existing folders in the filesystem to avoid typos (if 'new' is not set - see 'new')
    - new       used in combination with folder. is not used when folder is not set.
                if folder is defined, the closest match will be skipped and we use exactly what folder defines as albumartist and album. This result in a new folder structure, if the defined folder does not already exists.
