ToDo
- DONE: add youtube-dl als dl engine to avoid jdownloader-headless
- DONE: rewrite code to avoid vomiting
- implement YTIE in plexconverter.py
- implement filehandling to make files available in plex with plexconverter.py
  > problem: download is started async, so we have to find a way to determine when a DL is done to start with further processing
